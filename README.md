# File-Storage
Build a platform for saving, sharing files like as google drive.


### What we need?:

    Design and build RESTfull API (CBVs are more ambitious).
    User auth (register/login/) features in brackets is enough.

    Main part:
        ◦File uploading/saving/deleting
        ◦File sharing with other users
        ◦File permissions:
            ▪read,
            ▪change file.
        ◦Grouping files by its author. (e.g.: Media folder, Important docs, Videos, or anything that author can rename)
