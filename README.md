# File-Storage
Build a platform for saving, sharing files like as google drive.


What we need?:
  Design and build RESTfull API (CBVs are more ambitious).
  User auth (register/login/) features in brackets is enough.
  Main part:
    ◦File uploading/saving/deleting
    ◦File sharing with other users
    ◦File permissions:
        ▪read,
        ▪change file.
    ◦Grouping files by its author. (e.g.: Media folder, Important docs, Videos, or anything that author can rename)
